## What is PCA?

PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a technique that reduces the number of features in a dataset while keeping most of the useful information.

In simple words:
> PCA converts many related features into fewer new features called principal components.

These new features:
- Are uncorrelated
- Capture maximum information
- Make data simpler and faster to process
